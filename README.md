ONLY WORKS IN LINUX!

Run the terminal:
1) Download the zip and unzip it.
2) Go into the `Final` folder.
3) Right click in the file explorer and select the option to open in terminal.
4) Run `./mk`.
5) If that doesn't work, run `chmod +x mk`, then redo previous command.
6) Execute a command like you would in a normal Linux terminal!

Accessing files in the disk:
1) Run `./show` and run any command on the files in the disk.
2) Run `./hide` to unmount the disk.
